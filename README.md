This is going to be a very basic and fundamental repo for gaining a good grip and understanding on the building blocks of NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING:

*TOKENIZATION*
it is basically dividing the whole sentence into words 
can also be used to divide a paragh into sentences 

*POS TAGGING*
assigning word types like nouns and etc to the tokens made

*LEMMATIZATION*
reducing the words to base form 

*STEMMING*
reducing the words to a root word 

*STOP WORDS*
common words like is, the and all which do not add much value to the sentence 
removing them will reduce noise in the text analysis 

*NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION*
identifying entites in text like names, dates etc

*TEXT NORMALIZATION*
cleaing the text kinda thing which includes *lowercasing ; removing punctuations, numbers, htms tags ,special charecters*
